# 800L-SMS

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

Things that could help. 

* Update Line 7, SMS_TARGET with the number you want to send to, // SMS_TARGET Example for UK +44XXXXXXXXX
* If Sending from an iPhone make sure you send as SMS, I had to disable iMessage settings. 
* Tested in the UK on the EE Network and found out the hard way the Pay-As-You-Go Sims stopped working after 6 months of no activity.
* At some point in the future the 2G/3G networks will be disabled or turned off, so the 800L will likely stop working.
